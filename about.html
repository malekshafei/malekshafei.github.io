                    The first football match I watched was Egypt losing to Algeria and failing to qualify for the 2010 World Cup. Despite the despair of the moment, the experience created a craving in my heart for Egyptian football. Although I have cloesley followed Premier League and MLS football over the years, I have always felt the strongest connection with following the careers of Egyptian footballers abroad. This motivated me to join the Egyptian sports website KingFut as a writer when I was 14 years old. I began by covering the weekly performances of the Egyptians playing in Europe, from Mohamed Salah's historic first season at Liverpool to Ahmed Elmohamady's almost-constant cycle of promotions and relegations, I even got to interview Amro Tarek as he become the first Egyptian to sign for my local team - the New York Red Bulls.

                    I quickly grew a passion for broader issues relating to African football, especially the reasons why African football was so stunted in it's development compared to practically every other continent. This motivated me to create a long-form blog on African football called AfricanFtbl. I compiled a team of writers from almost every African country, and published over 100 features on a variety of topics ranging from the lasting impact of apartheid on South African football to ranking the top acaadmies on the continent. I posted daily on social media platforms for three years â€“ gaining a combined following of over 50,000 followers across platforms. However, what really stood out to me was player profiling. I highlighted many young players on the African continent, with the eye of shining a light on them ahead of potential moves to Europe.
